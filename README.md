A simple Blog. This example demonstrates how to create real world applications
using Nitro and AppEngine.

WARNING: this example is under construction!!

Homepage: http://nitrojs.org/

Source & Download: http://github.com/gmosx/blog-gae/

Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/nitro-devel

Issue tracking: http://github.com/gmosx/nitro/issues

IRC: #nitro on irc.freenode.net    


Getting Started
---------------

This example depends on several Narwhal (www.narwhaljs.org) packages:

* narwhal
* jack
* nitro
* appengine
* template

At the moment, customized version of Narwhal and Jack are required. Please get patched versions from:
    
http://github.com/gmosx/jack
http://github.com/gmosx/narwhal

...

The application will start listening at localhost:8080, so use your favourite browser to verify that everything works correctly.
